## Tasks

---

### 0. No JQuery

**Filename**: `0-script.js`

**Description**:
  - I wrote a JavaScript script that updates the text color of the `<header>` element to red (`#FF0000`).
  - I utilized `document.querySelector` to select the HTML tag.
  - I made sure not to use the JQuery API.

### 1. Using JQuery

**Filename**: `1-script.js`

**Description**:
  - I wrote a JavaScript script that changes the text color of the `<header>` element to red (`#FF0000`).
  - I opted not to use `document.querySelector` to select the HTML tag.
  - Instead, I leveraged the JQuery API for this task.

### 2. Interactive Color Change

**Filename**: `2-script.js`

**Description**:
  - I created a JavaScript script that modifies the text color of the `<header>` element to red (`#FF0000`) whenever a user clicks on the `DIV#red_header` tag.
  - I refrained from using `document.querySelector` to select the HTML tag.
  - I utilized the JQuery API to accomplish this interactive feature.

### 3. Class Manipulation with a Click

**Filename**: `3-script.js`

**Description**:
  - I designed a JavaScript script that appends the class `red` to the `<header>` element when the user clicks on the `DIV#red_header` tag.
  - I avoided the use of `document.querySelector` to interact with the HTML tag.
  - For this implementation, I relied solely on the JQuery API to manage the class addition.

### 4. Dynamic Class Switching

**Filename**: `4-script.js`

**Description**:
  - I developed a JavaScript script that dynamically toggles between the classes `red` and `green` for the `<header>` element whenever the user clicks on the `DIV#toggle_header` tag.
  - The `<header>` always retains one class, either `red` or `green`, ensuring it's never simultaneously both or empty.
  - I specifically avoided the use of `document.querySelector` for HTML tag interactions, and instead, I made full use of the JQuery API to manage the class switching.

### 5. Dynamically Adding List Items

**Filename**: `5-script.js`

**Description**:
  - I crafted a JavaScript script that appends a new `<li>` element to a list whenever the user clicks on the `DIV#add_item` tag.
  - The new element I added has the structure: `<li>Item</li>` and is appended to the `UL.my_list`.
  - To achieve this, I specifically refrained from using `document.querySelector` to interact with the HTML tags. Instead, I utilized the JQuery API to dynamically add items to the list.
